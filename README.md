<p><h1>Hands-on-Azure</h1></p>
In this walkthrough, I provide a step-by-step guide to some Azure concepts that I've practiced while studying Azure fundamentals.

<h2>Tools Used for Practice</h2>

- Azure portal
- Virtual Machines
- Resource Groups

<h2>Configuring basic VM settings</h2>

<p>
<h4>Step One</h4>

  Here we configure the basics of a virtual machine. These steps include naming the VM, assigning it to a resource group, and selecting the size and image of the machine. The username and password are also set up for the virtual machine to log in.</b>
  
  <h4>Step Two</h4>

  We  didn’t configure the disk or network options bc considering the default standard doesn’t affect our mock VM much.

  <h4>Step Three</h4>

  Once we review and create, we receive a summary of our virtual machine, including all configurations and the estimated hourly cost. Azure usually takes a few minutes to validate and deploy these machines.
